# PyMolTint
PyMolTint is a PyMOL plugin designed to enhance the visualization of molecular structures by allowing users to easily highlight specific residues with color and markers. This tool simplifies the process of marking residues with colored spheres, helping to emphasize important areas in a molecular structure for better analysis and presentation.
1. **af2color:** set colors for atoms in the loaded PDB file based on the atom_plddts values from the JSON file.
2. **show_residue_sphere:**  adds a colored sphere at the position of a specified residue in the loaded structure.
